Criteria to base the feedback on:

- Does the map have a logical structure (for example, flowing from main contention at the top, to main arguments next, to supporting arguments, to evidence and examples)?
- Is the labelling of textboxes correct (for example, what is an argument is labelled as an argument; and what is evidence is labelled as evidence)?
- Does the map include a valid interpretation of the main contention?
- Have the main arguments been accurately represented?
- Has the logical sequence of the lines of argument been accurately represented?
- Have the points within each textbox been clearly expressed?
- Are there any major omissions from the article in the map?
- Has more information than is necessary to effectively summarise the article been provided in the map?
- Degree of effort that has gone into developing the map?
- Overall understanding of the article displayed?
